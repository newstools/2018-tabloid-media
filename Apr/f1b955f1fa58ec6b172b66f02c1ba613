Former US president Barack Obama will deliver the
16 th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, said the Nelson Mandela Foundation, honouring the 100 th anniversary of Mandela’s birth. The Nelson Mandela Foundation together with the Obama Foundation announced today (23 April) that the lecture will take place on 17 July at the Ellis Park Arena in Johannesburg, a day before Nelson Mandela International Day. About 4000 people are expected to fill the stadium. To honour the centennial of Madiba’s birth the lecture’s theme is “Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing World”, said a spokesperson for the NMF. “The Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture will focus on creating conditions for bridging divides, working across ideological lines, and resisting oppression and inequality.” The Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture is seen as a unique platform to drive debate on critical social issues in South Africa and around the world. Said the spokesperson: “For most of his life, Nelson Mandela fought for democracy and equality. His presidency was defined by his efforts to solidify the fragile democracy of South Africa, and by his lessons on the politics of ‘bridge-building’ over the politics of division.” Previous speakers include global thought leaders and change makers, including former presidents Bill Clinton, Thabo Mbeki, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Mary Robinson and Michelle Bachelet; UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed; Nobel Laureates Kofi Annan, Wangari Maathai, Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Muhammad Yunus; professors Ariel Dorfman, Thomas Piketty and Ismail Serageldin; and philanthropists Bill Gates and Mo Ibrahim.
