The Department of Health in Newcastle took part in the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela commemorations that took place last week. Madikizela-Mandela passed away on 2 April, after an illness that kept her in hospital for a while.
Women across South Africa paid tribute to Mama Winnie Mandela as they dressed in #allblackwithadoek. Social media was abuzz with women posting photos of themselves dressed in solidarity with the hashtag. As part of celebrating her legacy, women were encouraged to wear all black clothes and doeks, as a symbol of unity and strength.
The memo was circulated via Whatsapp and the message reached far and wide. The stalwart was laid to rest at the private Fourways Memorial Park on Saturday, the same place her late great-granddaughter, Zenani Mandela was buried in 2010, after being hit by a car.
