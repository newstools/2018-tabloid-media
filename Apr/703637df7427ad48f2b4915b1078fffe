A baguette brought things to a boiling point at last weekend’s EFC 69 open workout when bantamweight rivals faced each other off for the first time. The championship fight took centre stage when South Africa’s JP Buys waved a baguette in the face of Frenchman Phillipe Rouch going on to strike him with it. Buys, the former EFC interim flyweight champion has moved up a division to chase his second EFC title. Meanwhile, Rouch is on a six fight win streak and earned the number one contender status. They are set to clash this Saturday, at Carnival City in Boksburg, Ekhuruleni, and it seems that the stakes have never been higher. After the baguette was destroyed by a visibly agitated Graeme Cartmell, EFC vice president of talent, the two refused to break eye contact in an exceptionally intense face-off. Co-headlining the event is EFC flyweight champ Nkazimulo Zulu who defends his title against his latest threat the Angolan predator Marino Cutendana. Featuring on the main too card is South Africa’s Pierre Botha as he tackles Scotland’s Calum Murrie, TF1 runner-up Ibrahima Mané challenges the heavy-handed South African Quiad Openshaw. And, a much-anticipated heavyweight clash is set to open the main card with a bang when South Africa’s Kevin Koekemoer takes-on Cameroon’s Nico Yamdjie. All these fights and more takes place this Saturday (28 April).
