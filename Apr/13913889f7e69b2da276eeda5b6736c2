Former Oakridge College learner Henri Schoeman is flying the South African flag high. The 26-year-old Durban North resident won South Africa’s first Commonwealth Games gold in the men’s Triathlon on Thursday. It was not surprising for many to see Schoeman exit the 600m swim in the front ranks. He crossed the finish line to take the 2018 Commonwealth title for Elite men in Triathlon with a seven second lead to Jacob Birtwhistle, in second place. Richard Murray secured a sixth place, 33 seconds down on Schoeman’s winning time. This was his first triumph since his victory at the ITU World Triathlon Abu Dhabi last month. The 2016 Olympic bronze medallist finished in a time of 52min 31sec seven seconds ahead of Birtwhistle.
