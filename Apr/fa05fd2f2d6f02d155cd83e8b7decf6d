St Benedicts School learners from Grade RR, Grade R and Grade 1 got into the Easter spirit on the last day of school with an Easter bonnet parade. Parents put a lot of effort into making gorgeous headgear for their special little people. Pictured are learners Kganya Kubu, Rikki Stedman and Kaden Clutties from Grade 1 showing off their Easter hats
