South Coast runner Deborah Berridge will be aiming to make the most of her tenth Comrades Marathon on 10 June to raise money for the CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation by running in the colours of The Cows. After moving down to the KZN South Coast she started her running career cautiously, but soon progressed to the point of being able to take on and complete her first Comrades with South Coast Striders in 2009. Totally bitten by the long distance running bug, Berridge used her new found passion for running to organise a series of local fun runs to allow her to raise money for a number of local charities. Excited by the prospect of earning her green permanent number for finishing her tenth Comrades, Berridge is going all out to try and reach a goal set by her club captain Mark Smith to raise R10 000 on her own to commemorate her tenth Comrades medal. Income from her fun runs, like her recent successful run on Easter Monday, and raffles have started to add up and local sponsors have helped make her dream a reachable reality. In addition to running for The Cows and their year-round support of the CHOC Childhood Cancer Foundation, Berridge will also be running to celebrate the victory over cancer of a school colleague Dean Ducroq who won his battle with leukaemia.
