Durban’s iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium and the glorious April weather make for the perfect pairing for the 2018 aQuellé Tour Durban Cycle Race presented by Bridge Fund Managers on Sunday 29. This will be the ideal way for both cyclists and volunteers to spend the Freedom Day weekend in support of the Tour Durban’s beneficiary, The Domino Foundation whose seven programmes impact the lives of almost 6000 people every day. Foundation’s Operations Manager, Shaun Tait said: “Our beautiful city hosts this incredible event for cyclists from across the country and we challenge cyclists to tackle the 45km fun-ride along the pristine Durban coastline to Umdloti and back. They can join the Domino charity batch in the 45km race, the perfect opportunity for companies, corporates and schools to enter teams to cycle in their company’s or school’s colours. If you’re up for it, contact us to get involved in this year’s event.” Late registration for the 2018 event will be held at the new Cycle Lab Megastore at Cornubia Mall. The Domino Foundation’s Volunteers Manager, Leanne Barker, can be reached on 031 563 9605 by anyone keen to volunteer to help all the 5000 or so cyclists on Friday 27 and Saturday 28 April.
