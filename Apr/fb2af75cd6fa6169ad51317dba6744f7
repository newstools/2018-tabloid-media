“It about communication and patience,” said Ellen Kritzinger at the couple’s 66th wedding anniversary. Lorrain and Ellen shared their moment with friends at the Durnford Lodge recently. The couple tied their knot in holy matrimony on 29 March 1952. “Marriage is not easy, but it worth it, if you both have unconditional love for one another,” said Ellen. She said that Lorrain approached her at a function telling her that he was in love with her, much to her surprise. “I was performing on stage at Louwsburg, in Vryheid, when Lorrain told me that he was in love with me,” said Ellen. This man came up to me after the show and told me that he was in love with me. And as they say the rest is history.”
