As excitement builds for the upcoming Salt march on 22 April, organisers say that President Ramaphosa has been invited to join the day of peace and unity. Organiser Satish Dhupelia said that he did not expect to hear from the President until the last minute. “We have also invited the President, but he hasn’t gotten back to us yet,” said Dhupellia. Duphelia reported that excitement is building among participants as the Gandhi Salt March fast approaches its big day. The free, non competitive 5km walk will pay tribute to stalwarts of peace: Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu as well as others who walked in the footsteps of Gandhi and Luthuili. Dhupelia said that wide public interest had been expressed via their online registration website. “We have received a lot of people who have registered online. People are very excited that they have the chance to carry the torch- a number of people are volunteering to carry the torch and we are allowing people to call in and put their name down to carry the torch for a little while each,” added Dhupelia. With good weather on the cards preparations are looking good for the day. “The weather has been good lately and we are expecting the march to be a success,” added Dhupelia. The aim of the day is to ‘walk for peace’ and meet other like minded souls and make new friends. The walk starts at the Amphitheatre at 8am sharp and goes to uShaka and back. T-shirts and Medals are given to the first 1000 participants. Registration for the walk is on the day from 6am at the site but one can also pre-register by using the website www.saltmarch.org.za or email sm@gdt.org.za.
