She is a mother, daughter, wife, senior manager and now a Glow TV Mrs India South Africa finalist. The 38-year-old Tongaat mother of three boys could not find the words to describe her excitement after she was chosen as a finalist for the competition. Melanie Pillay will participate in the Glow TV Mrs India SA 2018 finals. She told theTongaat and Verulam Tabloid that this was her first pageant, and that she was motivated by her friend who saw potential in her to participate. “I love empowering others and helping them become more confident and being the very best that they can be. I am currently involved in various outreach projects,” said Pillay. She described her mother as her ‘greatest source’ of inspiration. “She is a woman of great strength and courage who has overcame many trials and tribulations through the grace of God.” She said that the opportunity was a blessing that would help boost all that she is passionate about. “I was so thrilled and honoured when I got a call to tell me that I was the one of the finalists selected in the whole of South Africa. It feels super awesome but this journey is not just about me. I want to be an example to others, if I can do this so can they,” said Pillay. Her friends and family have been overdosing her with love and support. “To every amazing woman out there, remember that you are beautiful and wonderfully made. You are born to live victorious lives. With God at the centre of your life, hard work and perseverance, you can achieve anything. The sky is not the limit but the beginning,” added Pillay.
