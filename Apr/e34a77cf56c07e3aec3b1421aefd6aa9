Just two days after being handed down a five-year sentence for poaching in a case that has made headlines globally, Bollywood superstar Salman Khan (52), was released from jail on Saturday after a court granted him bail whilst he appeals his prison sentence. Bad boy Khan, one of India’s iconic actors, received the five year sentence after he was convicted for killing two blackbucks while working on a film in Rajasthan in 1998. The endangered blackbuck is a type of antelope found in India. Khan’s bail was granted on Saturday after his attorney’s filed an appeal against the sentence in a higher court and requested bail. Khan paid 50 000 Indian rupees in bail and was said to have returned to Mumbai. The conditions for his bail, bans Khan from traveling outside India without the court’s permission and he has to appear in court on May 7, according to media reports. His conviction resulted from a hunt that occurred in 1998 in Rajasthan where it was alleged that Khan shot the two blackbucks whilst out in the company of some of his co-stars. He pleaded not guilty and has since maintained his innocence.
