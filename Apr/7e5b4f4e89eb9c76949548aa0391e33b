Keeping up with Drakie tradition, Drakensburg Primary School held its annual dress-up event encouraging learners to come dressed as their favourite storybook characters. The event aims to inspire learners to read and to visit the media centre at school. Learners took to the event with enthusiasm, going all out to recreate some of the most memorable fiction characters. The school thanked the parents for making an effort and supporting their children with this project.
