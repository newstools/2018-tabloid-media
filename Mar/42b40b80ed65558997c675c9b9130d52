A man who had sustained serious injuries after colliding with a pole was then robbed of all his valuables whilst he awaited medical assistance on Wednesday afternoon. Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson, said, “Rescue Care Paramedics responded to the accident along Cato Manor Road just after 1pm. On arrival, they found the badly damaged vehicle on the roadside. The driver, who had serious injuries as a result of the collision, was then approached by bystanders who he thought were coming to assist him, however, they robbed him of all his valuables.
The man was stabilised by Advanced Life Support Paramedics on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required.” Jamieson said SAPS members were on scene and will investigate further.
