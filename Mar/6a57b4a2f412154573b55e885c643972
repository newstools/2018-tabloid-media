After an eight-week staff strike over salary increments, Durban University of Technology (DUT) announced that the strike was over on Thursday,15 March when DUT management signed a settlement agreement with the leadership of all three Labour Unions (NEHAWU, TENUSA and NTEU) at the CCMA. DUT’s Senior Director for Corporate Affairs, Alan Khan said that DUT staff would be given a 7% basic salary increase to be implemented this month. Additionally, there would be a R200 increase in the monthly housing allowances. “In alleviating cash flow constraints encountered by employees who participated in the protected strike and whose salaries were docked as a result of the no work no pay principle being applied, DUT offers a salary advance which will come into effect on the employee’s request,” said Khan. The salary advance lots would include amounts: R3000, R6000, R9000 up to the maximum of R12 000 and would be repayable over a period of eight months.”The employer shall waiver the application of no work no pay principle, only in respect of 13 days of the strike,” added Khan. Chairperson for NEHAWU, Mike Mbatha said that strikers were not completely happy with the end result. “This was a compromise between both parties to go forward and continue teaching and learning. We are happy that the strike is over after so long,” added Mbatha. The academic programme and all operations of the University are back to optimal functionality since last week and details of the revised academic calendar will be communicated to students by individual faculties, including the catch-up interventions, to make up for lost time. “The University will work tirelessly to ensure that all catch-up interventions are implemented timeously, in order to diligently fulfil all the requirements of our academic programme,” said Khan.
