Yesterday, two accused, Darryl Murrisson (33) and Christopher Houston (26) appeared in the Durban Magistrates’ Court for murder. They were remanded in custody until 7 March 2018 for a formal bail application. Police spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said, “The accused were arrested on 26 February 2018 and one of the accused was found at his place of residence with a pistol in his possession and two magazines with eight rounds of ammunition. The firearm has been sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if it was used in the murder.” On 24 February 2018 at 20:35, Bianca Parsons (33) was seated in her vehicle with her three-year-old child on Tara Road waiting for her husband who was inside the service station shop when an unknown gunman fired shots at her. She was pronounced dead at the scene and her child was not injured. A case of murder was opened at Wentworth police station for investigation. Swift police action led to the arrest of two men and the recovery of the firearm suspected to be used in the killing of Parsons. “Immediate police investigation which led to the arrest of the suspected murderers and the recovery of the firearm is commended. We will ensure that we gather enough evidence and send a well-prepared docket to court for a successful prosecution,” said the KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa.
