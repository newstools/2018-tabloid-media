Bianca Parsons’ murder accused, Darryl Murrisson, 33, and Christopher Houston, 26, were remanded in custody after they appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court for their bail application bid on Wednesday. Murrisson disclosed that he wants to plead guilty to the young mum’s murder whilst Houston will apply for bail next week.
Both men are to appear in court on 14 March. The suspects were arrested on 26 February for the cold-blooded killing of mum, Bianca Parsons, last month. Parsons is believed to have been shot in an apparent case of mistaken identity when the gunman walked up to her car and fired at her in full view of her three-year-old daughter, on Saturday, 24 February 2018, outside a fuel station on Tara Road. She was declared deceased on scene. Family, friends and community members gathered outside the Durban Magistrates’ Court calling for #JusticeForBianca. The contingent of supporters for the slain mum showed up in their numbers calling for bail to be denied for both murder accused as they hoisted placards in a peaceful protest outside court and later filled the court room, eager to ensure that the wheels of justice move unhindered. A Facebook page for the murdered mum has been set up ‘Justice for Bianca’ encouraging community members and the public to show their support for justice in the upcoming murder case.
