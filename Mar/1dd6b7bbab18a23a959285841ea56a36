Armed robbers held up a businessman on his way to the bank and robbed him of R25 000 in cash on Monday morning. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the businessman had just left the premises of
his business in the Durban CBD when four suspects held him up at gunpoint and robbed him. The incident occurred
at around 10am. “The armed gang held up the businessman as he walked across the road to where his vehicle was parked. They robbed him of his bag, which contained the cash. They fled the scene in a grey BMW with no registration plates. No injuries were reported,” Mathios said. Point SAPS attended the scene of the crime. Mathios advised business owners to be alert when travelling to and from
the bank, especially around month-end when criminals are aware that businesses are usually busy and staff wages are paid. “Always be vigilant when going out to do banking or driving back to the bank because criminals often stake out victims before striking. Try to take a manager or a colleague with you to do the banking and be sure to vary the days and times that you bank cash or draw funds,” Mathios said. “By varying the routes that you travel to and from the bank you can also greatly reduce the risk of becoming a target and always make sure that you are not being followed by criminals. If you sense that a suspicious vehicle is tailing you, test this by taking a few turns in succession that takes you in a circle around the block. Drive to your nearest police station or call your security company if the vehicle continues to follow you,” Mathios said. Mathios advised businessmen and women to also be alert to any individuals standing outside the bank using a cellphone because spotters are sometime used to identify potential victims who are then followed back to their business premises where they are robbed.
