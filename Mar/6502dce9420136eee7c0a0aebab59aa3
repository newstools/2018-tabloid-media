Autism Awareness supporters can ‘walk the walk’ on Saturday, 21 April at 8am by taking part in a 5km walk / run or a 10km run along the beachfront promenade, beginning at Natal Mounted Rifles on the corner of Masabalala Yengwa Avenue and Isaaih Tshangase Road. The run will promote awareness about Autism and promote inclusion in schools and access to services for those with Autism. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), affects one in 68 people and refers to a range of conditions characterised by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as unique strengths and differences. There’s many types of autism caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences. The most obvious signs of Autism tend to appear between 2 and 3 years of age. In some cases, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Funds raised at the event will go towards creating a community therapy centre that is self-sufficient and will go on to providing therapy for those in the low income sector because autism is not usually covered by medical aid. The race is open to everyone, including people with autism or those who know and love someone with Autism as well as those who support ASD. To register log onto www.eventtiming.info or go to Musgrave Shopping Centre on Saturday, 14 April between 10am and 2pm and again on Friday, 20 April between 3pm and 5pm. The cost is R80 (5km) R100 (10km). For more information email blueandyourun@gmail.com or call 031-837 0352.
