Grade 1 learners at St Benedict School have been learning about the Letterland characters this term in Phonics. They celebrated how far they have come by having a ‘P’ Party, with everyone coming to school dressed as something beginning with the letter ‘P’. Policemen, pirates, princesses, lots of pyjamas and even Pocahontas and pilots joined in the fun. The day ended with games like ‘pass the parcel’ and a picnic.
