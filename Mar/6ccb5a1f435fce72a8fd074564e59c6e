Egg-cited for Easter! As Easter weekend approaches, many will take time to remember the Cross of Calvary on Good Friday and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ with Sunday services full of light. Children will be spreading the joy with whimsical easter egg hunts and the sweet treats left behind by the Easter Bunny.
Associated with spring festivals, the egg is said to be an ancient symbol of new life, while a Christian perspective is that Easter eggs represent Jesus’ emergence from the tomb and resurrection. Pictured are Rachel, Oliver Rosettenstein and Troy Naidoo who are ‘egg-cited’ for an Easter egg hunt at the Botanic Gardens this weekend.
