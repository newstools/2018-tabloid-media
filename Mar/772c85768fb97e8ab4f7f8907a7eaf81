Darryl Morrison (33), one of the accused in the Bianca Parsons murder, said he was sorry for shooting and killing the Bluff mum as she was not his intended target. Morrison and Christopher Houston (26), both of Wentworth, face murder charges after they were linked to Parson’s cold-blooded killing through CCTV footage from the local garage where the tragedy occurred. The case was heard in the Durban Magistrate’s Court today. Parsons was shot in full view of her three-year-old daughter last month whilst she was seated in their vehicle at a local fuel station on Tara Road. Her husband had stepped out to make a purchase at the convenience store. According to Morrison, the target that he missed had been parked next to Parsons. He revealed that the person he had intended killing had allegedly been involved in the death of a relative in 2017. Morrison indicated that he had not seen Parsons face when he had pulled the trigger. The court heard that Morrison was very remorseful for his actions and in an unexpected twist added that Houston had not been involved in the murder. Morrison stated that he acted on impulse and had used his own unlicensed firearm in the fatal shooting. Houston’s bail application continues in light of Morrison’s statements.
