An Amanzimtoti resident was shot by an intruder in the early hours of Sunday morning. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said suspects had climbed over the perimeter fence of the property in Andrew Craven Place at around 3am. “The suspects managed to break the handle of a bedroom window as they attempted to break into the house. The resident approached the window to investigate and one of the suspects fired a shot which hit the resident in his stomach,” Mathios said. “ER 24 paramedics responded to the scene and transported the victim to hospital in a stable condition.” Mathios cautioned residents not to investigate suspicious noises or movements on their properties, especially at night. “If you suspect that there could be an intruder on your property rather hit your panic button and let an armed response officer come and investigate. You never know how many suspects could be on the property and whether they are armed and if you are walking into a dangerous situation,” Mathios said.
