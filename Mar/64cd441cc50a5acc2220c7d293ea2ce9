East Coast Radio’s Darren Maule supported the CANSA Shavathon with zany red and green hair that was nothing short of ‘radio-active’ colour. The Shavathon took place on Saturday, 24 February from 9am until 4pm at Suncoast and selected shopping centres across Durban. The fun, family-friendly event encouraged Durbanites to live #LoudInColour and support the worthy cause. This year marked the fifteenth shavathon. Behind Shavathon’s colourful spectacle lies the reality of this disease and the shaving or spraying of hair has become symbolic gestures in support of cancer patients and cancer survivors.
