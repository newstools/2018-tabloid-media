Her inspirational story of courage and strength of purpose in the face of a horrific crime made Jes Foord a heroine in the eyes of many South Africans. Following her traumatic gang rape by four men in 2008, she established the Jes Foord Foundation (JFF). The foundation will be honouring Jes’ journey by hosting a family fun day to thank the community, family and friends for all of their help and support throughout the first decade. The event takes place on Sunday, 25 March at WavePark Gateway. JFF is rooted in her personal journey after the horrific gang rape. As part of her healing process, she chose not to be another rape victim, but rather a survivor, and learned to become a spokesperson campaigning on behalf of women and children who had gone through similar harrowing experiences. This month marks a decade of proactiveness and of helping, inspiring and working hard to make a difference in supporting survivors of rape and their families, and teaching behavioural change to strive for a society free from rape and domestic abuse. Jes and her small team have over the years initiated various projects and campaigns, including the Handbag Project, the Cinderella Project, establishing the Marianhill Counselling Centre, the Young Men’s Mentorship Programme, Learners Awareness Impact Programme and the Actively Against initiative. Upon chatting with Jes on this milestone celebration, she was asked what her wish for the future would be. She simply responded: “My long term goal is not to be needed. I would like there to be no rape, no need for the foundation.” Join the JFF team for a fabulous, fun-filled family day with loads of entertainment, fun for the kids, splash pads, super slides, food stalls, gin bars and more. All ages allowed. No food or beverages are allowed into the park, but you are welcome to bring swimming costumes, blankets and chairs.
