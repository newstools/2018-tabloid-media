Durban motorists may have noticed an impromptu performance art act developing around the robots on Sandile Thusi (Argyle) Road. With faces painted white, the make-shift street performers can be seen acting for their drive-by audience on the busy street. What are they doing? Why do they stand there in their make-up? Three performer-cum-beggars recently shared their story with the Weekly Gazette. Blessing Khuzwayo (16) said that he has been begging along Sandile Thusi Road for three years. “Before, I was collecting rubbish from cars and I saw that I couldn’t make enough money like that, so I thought I must try something new,” said Khuzwayo. “I paint myself with white paint and I dance,” added the young beggar. The teen said that he is an orphan with a brother and sister who live out of town. He said he has “family problems” which prevent him from staying with his siblings. “I want to live like other people, but there is nothing I can do,” said Khuzwayo. Fellow masked, performer, Mongezi Mtolo (27) said that he decided to take to the streets when he failed to find a job. “I was working in Berea at a centre when they moved to Pinetown, they said they were going to take someone else. “I tried to find another job, but I didn’t find anything and I decided to come here because I didn’t want to do a bad thing and rob others,” said Mtolo. Another painter performer, Sibaniso Khumalo (28) said that the performers use “ceiling board chalk” mixed with water to create a white paste to paint their faces. “It is just to make people laugh,” said Khumalo, “I love acting.” The acting-enthusiast said that he had “nobody at home” but a younger brother who works as a car guard nearby. “I think this is better than working as a car guard because people break into cars ,” said Khumalo. The performers said that their antics earn them about R60-R70 per day and that they need around R150 to pay their shelter fees (R35) and pay for food and living costs.
