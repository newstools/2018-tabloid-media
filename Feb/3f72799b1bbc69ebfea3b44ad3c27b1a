Taxi violence resulted in the death of one person leaving three others severely injured following a drive-by shooting on Ireland Street in the Verulam CBD last Friday. “We are still investigating the motive of the shooting,” said Verulam police spokesperson Captain Henry Kisten. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa were dispatched to the scene after receiving multiple calls from the public reporting automatic gunfire in the taxi rank.
“Upon investigation it was established that the four taxi bosses were at the taxi rank on Ireland Street when the occupants of a red VW Golf 7 opened fire on them with high calibre weapons,” said Prem Balram. According to Balram one person was shot in the head and died at the scene. Two other people were shot multiple times and were transported to hospital in a critical condition. The fourth victim was shot twice but managed to flee to the Metro Police Station on Wick Street.
