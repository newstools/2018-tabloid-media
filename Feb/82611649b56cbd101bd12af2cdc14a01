The seventh edition of World Radio Day was held on 13 February under the theme, Radio and Sports, with all radio stations, regulatory bodies and related organisations invited to celebrate radio and its contribution to democratic debate through information, entertainment and audience interaction. “As we look forward to a year of momentous sporting events that have the ability to unite the hearts and minds of people everywhere as we called on all radio stations around the world to showcase the beauty of sports in all of its diversity. Let’s celebrate the traditional sports that connect us to our cultural heritage, the grassroots sports that anchor within our communities, and the inspiring stories that challenge gender stereotypes and covers, equally, both men’s and women’s sports events,” said Belinda Gurd of UNESCO.
