While the romance of Valentineâ€™s Day was being celebrated in the usual way among romantics, a group of learners from Egerton Primary School in Ladysmith decided to take it a step further. They wanted to show that love and care for animals was as important and went about collecting items like food, blankets and animal toys for cats and dogs. Their successful drive culminated in a donation to the Ladysmith-based Animal Anti-Cruelty League.
