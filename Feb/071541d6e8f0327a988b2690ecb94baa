Tskane Ward 9 Community Police Forum, Steadville and Ladysmith police recently joined in a campaign on crime awareness for the community. The teams went on a walk-about in the area, but more importantly to build a strong working relationship with the police, the CPF and the community. “We want to show the community that the police and CPF can work together to fight crime,” said Ward 9 Councillor General Hlubi, and CPF head. He said that people should also take responsibility in assisting in the fight against crime. “By working with the police and going to the CPF meetings, we can work to make Steadville streets safe.” General Hlubi was not shy of excitement and support when Ladysmith police arrived for the campaign. Said Ladysmith police’s communications officer, Captain Charmaine Struwig: “It was a three hour walk-a-bout, where informative pamphlets, with contact numbers were handed out to residents.” Hlubi hopes and prayers that the streets of his area can be release from the drug abuse, alcohol abuse and domestics abuse. “Together and working together we can make a difference.” Hlubi told The Ladysmith Herald that every neighbourhood in the Ladysmith and surrounding areas should join the CPF. “Talk, sharing information with
the police, because this is the only way we can beat crime in our backyard, by working tohegter with the police.”
