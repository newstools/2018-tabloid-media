A shootout between police and a gang of alleged house robbery suspects yielded the arrest of two suspects, two firearms and the recovery of a hijacked vehicle in Lamontville on Wednesday. The dramatic scenes played out when police spotted the suspects in the vehicle following reports of a house robbery in Bayview, on Wednesday afternoon. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said, “At about 4:20pm, KwaZulu-Natal police were involved in a shootout with suspects at Gwala Street, Lamontville. Two suspects were arrested, one with gunshot wound and the other was tackled by a canine.
They were taken to hospital for medical attention under police guard. The other two managed to evade arrest. Two firearms have been recovered.”
“It is alleged that four suspects in a white Mercedes Benz vehicle committed a house robbery in Corlia Avenue Bayview. “Police were alerted about the incident and they spotted the suspects’ getaway vehicle who then sped off towards Lamontville, shooting at the police. Police retaliated, injuring one suspect, other was tackled by a canine and the two fled on foot. None of the police officers were injured,” added Cpt Gwala.
She said investigations revealed that the suspects’ vehicle was hijacked at Umbilo nearly two weeks ago and one of the recovered firearms was taken during the house robbery in Durban North. Suspects will be charged for possession of unlicensed firearms, possession of stolen property and attempted murder. They will be linked to Umbilo hijacking, Bayview and Durban North house robberies. “We are happy that police officers escaped the shooting unscathed. Suspects will be profiled to ascertain if they can be linked to other serious and violent crimes in Durban and surroundings,” said the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa.
