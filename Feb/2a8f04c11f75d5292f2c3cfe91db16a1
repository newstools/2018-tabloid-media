MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo welcomed contracted oncologists from WITS Health Consortium at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital on Thursday, 15 February in a midday media briefing and oncology ward tour. The contract stipulates that 3 Oncologists from the WITS Health Consortium will each be offering their services for 8 hours a day starting on February 15, 2018, five (5) days in a week at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. It’s more like on everyday basis. “We are thus elated that 150 new patients and 300 follow-up patients per month will be seen at this hospital. These Oncologists have undertaken to hit the ground running as Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital has three (3) serviceable Linear Accelarators,” said Dhlomo. The top 5 cancers faced with in KwaZulu Natal are: Cervical cancer; Breast cancer; Colorectal Head and neck tumour and prostate cancer. For all types of cancers, the primary objective is at raising cancer awareness, prevention, treatment and care in our country said Dhlomo. “Overall, when it comes to screening, radiology and chemotherapy, KZN is doing well. In fact, the province’s efforts in this regard are being bolstered through the newly-launched National Cervical Cancer Prevention Policy (NCCPP)
and the Breast Cancer Prevention and Control Policy. This policy has enabled us to use Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC), which
is considered to be an alternative to conventional cytological investigations, known as the Pap smear,” said Dhlomo. While oncology deals with late stage cancer cases that require radiology the process of cancer treatment is effective added Dhlomo. Going forward this is expected to improve services as the contracted oncologists help to cut down waiting times for new patients to an average of 6 to 8 weeks.
