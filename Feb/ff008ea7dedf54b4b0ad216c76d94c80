The Support Women in Need (SWIN) organisation was recently launched at Mariannhill SAPS. Facilitator of SWIN, Shirlee Govender, under the directorship of Dr. Wendy Govender, explained that the event brought together women from Marianridge, Mariannhill and Pinetown. About 35 women of all race groups attended the launch. The purpose of SWIN was explained and the women were encouraged to be a part of this community initiative. Businesswoman, Jasmine Pillay, inspired the ladies to empower themselves by becoming entrepreneurs of small businesses and to also give back to the community. They were treated with meals and a gift that was sponsored by Pillay. Facilitator, Shirlee Govender, expressed her sincere thanksgiving and gratitude to all the women who made themselves available despite the lifeâ€™s obstacles. She added that a committee will be nominated in the future so that women can be empowered, educated and mentored accordingly.
