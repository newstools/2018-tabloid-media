In an effort towards donating a wheel-chair to someone in need, Kylie van Niekerk, a Grade 7 learner at St Henry’s Marist College, contributed a whopping 17kgs of bread tags towards a total of 45kg to be delivered to a local plastic fabrication company. The funds raised will be used to buy the wheel-chair. Kerry-Anne Francis, marketing, admissions and events manager of the school, said, “We are
now half-way towards getting a wheel-chair donated to someone in need. We have donated a wheel chair to a child previously.” Pictured is Kylie van Niekerk
