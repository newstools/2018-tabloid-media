Red is the preferred colour on Valentine’s Day and this 14 February, with the women in blue joining the masses in upholding the tradition of bestowing love and appreciation for loved ones through various gestures. Celebrated worldwide on 14 February, Valentine’s Day is an occasion where individuals grab the opportunity to exhibit feelings of love, affection and friendship to those they deem special to them. Valentine’s Day is named after Saint Valentine, a Catholic priest who lived in Rome in the third century. It is a day recognised as a significant cultural, religious, and commercial celebration of romance. A day where roses, hearts, chocolates, teddy bears and trinkets take centre stage and red is splashed vividly on every platform as a symbol for the colour of love. The mythical winged ‘Cupid’ also makes an appearance sporting his infamous bow and arrow, ready to instill love into the hearts of secret crushes.
