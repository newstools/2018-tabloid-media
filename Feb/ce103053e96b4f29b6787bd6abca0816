On Friday, 23 February 2018, the University of Zululand (UNIZULU) Campus Health Clinic will officially launch its on-campus offering of the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme which is aimed as an additional measure in protecting against HIV infections. This mass intervention will be marked by the attendance of Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, who will deliver the keynote address at the event. PrEP is an ARV drug combination taken to prevent HIV infection by HIV-negative people who are at a greater risk of acquiring the virus. An initiative of the national Health Department, UNIZULU makes history as the first higher education institution in KwaZulu-Natal to offer the programme. PrEP is currently only available to seven higher education institutions nationally that will become sites in rolling out the treatment to young people. UNIZULU was chosen as it meets the requirements for the programme such as staffing, the qualification of nurses, dispensing licences and adequate storage, to name but a few. The University was also chosen because it is already dispensing antiretroviral treatment (ART) to students living with HIV as well as other primary healthcare services. PrEP will be readily available as a prevention method to be used in conjunction with other prevention methods such as Universal Test and Treat (UTT), condoms and family planning, amongst others. “The University of Zululand is privileged to be the first university in the whole of KwaZulu-Natal province to be used as a target for the second national launch for PrEP,” said UNIZULU Campus Health Clinic Head, Sister Hlengiwe Mkhwanazi. PrEP was first launched as a pilot in 2016. The second rollout phase has now been updated to include additional target populations. Details of the event: Date: Friday, 23 February 2018
