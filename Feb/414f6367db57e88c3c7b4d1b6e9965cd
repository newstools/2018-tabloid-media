Fifteen women were arrested for suspected prostitution during an Umbilo raid that infiltrated three brothels on Friday, 16 February, from 10am to 1pm. The joint operation between SAPS, Metro Police and the local Community Policing Forum’s led to dagga trees and dagga being recovered along with dangerous weapons and cellphones that were suspected to be stolen. This is according to Metro Police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad. He added that another three suspects were arrested for possession of firearms. Sewpersad said that the operation was planned. “It was a very successful operation. There will be more of these undercover sting operations done in the neighbourhood,” said Sewpersad. The operation responded to the cries of the community. “We were receiving complaints from the neighbourhood and businesses in the area, hence we decided to jointly conduct this operation,” added Sewpersad. Mmbatho Tembe, Ward 33 Councillor, said that the number of brothels in the area was an issue that was being addressed. “We have been working with it and we have been asking the city to help out, it’s obviously not going to be solved immediately, but we are working toward it,” said Tembe.
