St Benedict School hosted their intermediate phase gala for Grade 4 to 7 learners on last Friday. The gala was competitive but proved to be loads of fun, with parents and learners enthusiastically cheering on the various sporting houses. Michael House won both the inter-house trophy with the most points and the spirit trophy.
