Child Welfare Chatsworth’s Salochna Naicker stated that the organisation  is concerned at the news of young children committing suicide. “Parents, guardians, care-givers, grandparents, foster parents and educators should be more vigilant and understanding to the following warning signs of child depression such as sudden change of behaviour, change of moods, wanting to be alone all the time, peer pressure, bullying and low self- esteem. As a preventative measure, Child Welfare Chatsworth is embarking on programmes with primary school children to equip them with coping skills to curb the programme of suicide,” said Naicker.
