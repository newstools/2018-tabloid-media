A 61-year-old pensioner was pistol-whipped and robbed when four armed ‘gold demanding’ suspects burst into his house on Tynecroft Road whilst he was mopping the floors on Friday evening. The gun-brandishing house robbers are alleged to have fled with a TV and a cellphone after a neighbour activated his panic alarm upon witnessing the robbery in progress. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “The 61-year-old alleged that he was alone at home. He had the driveway gate open as his son was coming home. He also had the front door and gate open as he was mopping the floor. Four men armed with firearms entered the lounge and demanded for ‘gold’. The elderly man was assaulted with the gun on his face by one of the suspects and sustained swelling. The suspects took a Samsung 42 inch TV and a Samsung S6 cellphone. The neighbour saw the suspects and pressed his panic alarm. The suspects then jumped into a brownish Hyundai SUV which had driven into the driveway and fled.” KZN VIP spokesman, Romano Naidoo, said, “KZN VIP Security and Medical responded to the scene and stabilised the patient before rushing him to hospital for further medical attention. Residents are urged to be security-wise. Locals especially the elderly cannot be lax with security as criminals strike in the blink of an eye. They prey on the elderly and children as they are ‘soft target’s. Please ensure gates and doors are secured at all times.”
