Activists from political parties made their way in protest to the Ladysmith Town Hall last Thursday to give their support to the community affected by service delivery. Over the last several months the greater Ladysmith area has been the hot bed of several service delivery protests, and it does not seem that it will be going away anytime soon. Political parties, including the EFF, IFP and NFP were outside the Town Hall to protest against poor service delivery and alleged corruption within the Alfred Duma Municipality. One of the questions asked in a memorandum, handed over to the Mayor of Alfred Duma, Vincent Madlala, was why does he have to employ so many body guards? “He has more body guards then KZN Premiers Willie Mchunu,” said one of the protesters. Other questions raised in the memorandum were about poor service delivery in rural areas, such as water and electricity. The march started at Kandahar Sport’s Field through the town towards the Ladysmith Town Hall. The Mayor, heavily surrounded by body guards and the police, received the memorandum from protestors.
