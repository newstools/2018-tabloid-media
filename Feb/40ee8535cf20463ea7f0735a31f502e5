South Africans wait with bated breath for a response from President Jacob Zuma after he was recalled to assume his presidency in a surprise announcement by the ANC on Tuesday. The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the African National Congress (ANC) convened a special meeting on Monday, 12 February 2018 at the Saint George Hotel, Tshwane. The meeting was called to reflect on the current situation as it pertains to the position of the President of the Republic of South Africa, Comrade Jacob Zuma. Speaking during a press conference at Luthuli House, ANC secretary general, Ace Magashule said the decision to recall Zuma is based on the party’s decision for the ANC president to be Head of State – reiterating that Zuma has not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law. “I think we must treat President Zuma as the president of the Republic of South Africa. President Zuma has not been found guilty by any court of
law. When we took these decisions, we did not take these decisions because comrade Jacob Zuma has done nothing wrong,” said Magashule. As the tussle for leadership of the country continues, Magashule was emphatic that the ANC wants Cyril Ramaphosa, the ruling party’s president and the country’s deputy president, to lead the country and deliver the State of the Nation Address (SONA).
Magashule said, “”When we recall our deployee, we expect the deployee to do what the organisation expects him to do. I don’t know what will happen but let’s leave it to President Jacob Zuma.” He added that it is critical that South Africans are united around the task of growth, job creation and economic transformation.
