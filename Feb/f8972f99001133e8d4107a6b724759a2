At gunpoint, the suspects forced the complainant to open the safe and removedan undisclosed cash. Whilst the suspects were fleeing the scene they were confronted by a security guard who sprayed them with pepper spray. One of the suspects then produced a firearm and fired a shot wounding the security guard in his eye.” “The suspects thereafter fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. No arrests or recoveries. The security guard was taken to hospital where he is in a critical condition. Charges of attempted murder and business robbery were opened at Durban Central police station for investigation,” said Lt/Col Zwane. According to an unnamed source who was on scene, three men, two of whom walked in and acted upon order whilst the third man, entered and closed the door. “The security then approached the third man and attempted to intervene. He was shot on the side of his head and an undisclosed amount of cash was taken. On escaping, the suspects could not open the door as it was locked so the suspects broke the shop glass and fled.Bystanders could not
halt the suspects as they brandished their weapons,” the anonymous source said.
