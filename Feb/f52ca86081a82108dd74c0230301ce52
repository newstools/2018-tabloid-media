It was a display of faith and endurance as devotees of the Isipingo Shree Siva Soobramoniar Temple (ISSS) on Jooma Road in Isipingo showed up in their numbers to offer their prayers to the Hindu God of War, Lord Muruga, at the annual Thai Poosam Kavady. Beautifully decorated kavadies adorned with brilliantly coloured blooms, feathers and cloths, lined the temple grounds. The worshippers, both young and old, sought to hoist the structure on their shoulder, symbolising the carrying of their burdens in favour of Lord Muruga’s guidance and help. The prayers were conducted by Guru Pranavin Naicker. Devotees offered the deity milk whilst some of them opted to pierce their bodies in a trance state with various items like coconuts and limes hanging from the pins as a sign of their faith. Certain staunch devotees vow to pull a chariot with the pins pierced on their bodies. ISSS PRO, Jugga Pillay, said it was heartwarming to see the youth’s devotion to the fast and the prayer. “These are our future leaders and they will carry our traditions and uphold our culture for the next generation,” said Pillay. Local security, Alpha Alarms stepped up patrols during the preparations and the main prayer day. Spokesman, Seshin Govender said, “The safety of devotees was of great concern to us. “There have been sporadic attacks on places of worship and with the recent spate of hijackings, we wanted the worshippers to feel a semblance of safety and security during their prayer time especially as Jooma Road is often used as a quick getaway route by hijackers.”
