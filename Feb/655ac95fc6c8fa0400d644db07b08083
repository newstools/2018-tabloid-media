A man believed to be in his 20’s sustained severe injuries when he fell from a tree and was impaled on a fence on NMR Avenue before Goble Road on Saturday evening. Rescue Care Operations Director, Garrith Jamieson, said, “Around 8:30pm, Rescue Care Paramedics were called to the scene for urgent medical assistance. Paramedics found a man hanging upside down impaled on the fence by both his legs. Together with EMRS and Durban Fire Department, it was decided that we needed to cut the fence to effectively treat the patient.”
“Durban Fire Department used tools to cut a section of the fence off and then carefully lowered the fence with the man still impaled on it to the ground.
Advanced Life Support Paramedics then worked to stabilise the man who had sustained serious lower limb injuries. The Fire Department then cut the rest of the fence around the man cautiously. Once the man was stabilised on the scene he was then rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital for the urgent care that he required,” added Jamieson. He said the events leading up to the incident are unknown however SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further.
