Two murders and a suicide have rocked Ladysmith. First, the body of a woman was found on Geluksberg Rd, about 25 km outside Ladysmith, then another woman was shot allegedly by the same man, who later took his own life. The body of the first woman was discovered by a motorist travelling along the dirt road, who initially thought that the person was sleeping on the side of the road. But, according to Ladysmith police spokesperson, Captain Charmaine Struwig, it was discovered that the woman was shot. Police managed to trace the family of the victim, whose father exclaimed on seeing her: “That is my daughter laying there.” A family friend claimed that she was shot by her boyfriend. It could not be established whether the woman was shot where she was found, or whether her body was dumped there after she was shot elsewhere. According to the family friend the suspect then travelled to Ezakheni where he shot another woman and then himself. The body of second the woman has not yet been identified. Struwig, told the Ladysmith Herald that nothing could as yet be confirmed on the circumstances around the shootings and if the two shootings were indeed linked. “Further investigations need to be concluded before an official comment can be given. The motive of the killings and alleged suicide is unknown and police are investing,” said Struwig.
