As the DUT staff strike continues in a deadlock, the university’s Executive Committee of Senate has taken a decision to suspend all academic programmes until further notice. DUT’s Senior Director of Corporate Affairs, Alan Khan issued a statement to say that the staff strike has delayed some academic programmes and that the university will announce the revised 2018 academic calendar next week. Although the academic programme of the University may be suspended, DUT remains operational. Students who have not yet registered may still proceed to registration. Despite, the staff strike, 21000 student have been registered for the 2018 academic year. Staff seen striking on Monday, 5 February at DUT’s Steve Biko
Campus. “DUT would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused during this trying period for the University. The management of the University would like to thank all its stakeholders for their continued understanding, support and patience. The University is committed in resolving the current crisis,” said Khan. The strike that began when staff demanded a salary increase has been ongoing due to unsuccessful negotiations. On Friday, 9 February, DUT management sent its final offer to their staff. While strikers had demanded a 10% salary increase along with an extra R400 to be added to their R1100 housing allowance and a R9000 once off bonus, the DUT final offer was for a 6.5% increase on basic salary and a 6.5% increase on housing allowance which had increased from the 5.75 % salary increase that was offered previously. On 13 February, the strike had exceeded 21 days and a limited reprieve of the no-work-no-pay principle was offered to staff. DUT has urged both staff and students to keep checking the DUT website, Pinboard and their emails for any official announcements and communiques. Registration can be done online via the DUT website: www.dut.ac.za or alternatively in person at the Riverside Campus in Pietermaritzburg and any of the Durban registration venues.
