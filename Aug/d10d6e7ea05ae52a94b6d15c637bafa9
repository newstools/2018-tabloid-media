The Japanese Gardens, north of Durban, is undergoing a major upgrade which will include a beautiful wedding venue and a solid wall along Waterkant Road to bolster security in the park. The revamp, which is expected to be completed in nine months is estimated at R5.5-million rand. 
 Parks, Recreation and Culture Unit Chief Horticulturist, Jay Chetty, said the project will begin with the Japanese Gardens wedding area, where a new brick wall will be constructed. According to Chetty,  the upgrade will improve the aesthetics and also enhance security at the facility, ensuring the safety of patrons, employees and discourage property vandalism.
Another addition that residents can look forward to, is the extra parking area that will be accommodated in the revamp. This will include the upgrade of the current parking space and lighting to compliment the new upgrade. Residents and visitors will love the newly revamped vow area as it will be complimented with a stairway leading to the new reception area.
Chetty said the area will be 30 metre by 15 metre in size, and spacious enough to accommodate structured marquees for events held at the facility. “The revamp includes separate ablution facilities for the convenience of the wedding guests,” he said.
