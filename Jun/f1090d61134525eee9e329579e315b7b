This year marks the 60th Anniversary of the Durban Group areas proclamation of 1958. This proclamation affected many communities and became a tragic tale of racial discrimination that saw thousands of people being displaced from a place they called home. 
 
People from Magazine Barracks, Railway Barracks, Cato Manor, Seaview, Hillary, Greyville and other parts of Durban were forced to relocate to Umlazi, Chatsworth, Phoenix and other areas. To recall this event, the 1860 Heritage centre will host a commemorativetalk on 30 June, from 2pm to 3.30pm, at the 1860 Heritage Centre, to hear from the communities most affected by this horrendous proclamation. There will be representations from the affected communities who will recall their experiences of displacement and relocation.  This event will provide the ideal networking platform to engage with affected communities in gathering historical data, while allowing ordinary people a platform to speak about their lived experiences.
 
Presentations will also be done by specialist researchers Karthi Gopalan, Brij Maharaj & Mphumeleli Ngidi.
