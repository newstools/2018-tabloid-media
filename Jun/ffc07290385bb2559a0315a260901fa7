Disgruntled illegal hawkers took to the Old Main Road in the Isipingo CBD in protest after Metro Police enforced the by-laws leaving scores of the traders seething and in violation of the law. Protestors burnt tyres and garbage on Old Main Road in the Isipingo CBD and Metro Police was quickly on scene together with security units etc. The roadway was blocked and traffic came to a standstill. Ward 90 Councillor Sunil Brijmohan, who was on scene, said, “It is ‘Catch 22 situation’ as the illegal hawkers are trying to eke out a living but in doing so they need to abide by the by-laws by obtaining the proper permits which they have not done. The by-laws have to be upheld, thus the illegal hawkers are up in arms.” Isipingo Business Forum (IBF) chairman, Junaid Iqbal, said, “The Municipality embarked on an initiative months ago to help illegal hawkers by informing them of the processes that need to be followed in order to legitimize their trading. The illegal hawkers failed to comply with what was required and then protested when the by-laws were enforced. At the end of the day, the law must be upheld and help was extended to the illegal hawkers.”
