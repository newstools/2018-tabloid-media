The man accused of murdering Durban North woman Siam Lee, 20, was released on R40 000 bail last Wednesday. The 30-year-old Assagay businessman faces several charges, including the murder and kidnapping of Lee, crimen injuria, fraud, attempted murder and an unrelated rape charge. Lee was abducted from a Durban North brothel on 4 January. Her charred body was found on a farm in New Hanover in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands two days later. The accused was arrested on 17 January. Following a five-month bail application, magistrate Mohamed Motala ruled on Wednesday that in addition to weaknesses in the Stateâ€™s case, there were exceptional circumstances for the accused to be released on bail. Motala said the accused has 17 staff members that are dependent on his bio-fuel business including his mother and little brother. He imposed strict bail conditions that the accused was to live at his family home in Sobantu, Pietermaritzburg, and not at his home in Kloof. He also has to report to the police station weekly and notify the investigating officer when he plans to leave the province for business. His next court appearance is on 17 August when the matter is expected to be transferred to the Durban High Court for a trial date to be set.
