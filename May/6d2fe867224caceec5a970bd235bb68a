“My mum has been my saving grace in raising my daughter and she is now such an exceptional grandmother.” As the world commemorates Mother’s Day on Sunday, 13 May, a special day that celebrates, honours and acknowledges the role and influence of mothers in
society, three generations of the Hardcastle family will be celebrating together. Posing side by side are mothers and daughters across three generations. Daughter and mother, Kelly Slogrove (left) said that there is a close bond shared between mothers and daughters in her family. The Weekly Gazette would like to wish all mothers a joyous Mother’s Day this weekend.
