An urgent appeal has been made by The SAPS KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Provincial Task Team to identify individuals who were allegedly involved in the violence at Moses Mabhida on 21 April. On Monday, the police announced the arrest of two suspects in connection with the incident. Both the suspects appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Tuesday for charges of public violence. The first arrest is that of a 21-year-old scholar from Newlands West. A headphone and a cordless microphone was recovered from him. The second arrest is that of a 42-year-old gardener from Hillcrest. “We welcome the that fact that suspects are beginning to contact the investigating officers in order for them to have their day in court and we are encouraging the outstanding suspects to do so immediately before police officers pounce on them,” said KZN SAPS spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker. The investigating team in conjunction with the senior public prosecutor have released images of persons who they believe can assist them in the investigation.”We are appealing to those captured on these images to please contact the investigating officers immediately. We are also appealing to members of the public who are in a position to identify these individuals, to also contact Captain Reddy on 082 458 5630 or Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana on 082 662 7764,” Brigadier Naicker said. He assured that all information will be treated with the strictest confidence and those who wish to remain anonymous can do so.
