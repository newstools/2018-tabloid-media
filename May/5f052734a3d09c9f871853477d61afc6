Christopher Houston, 26, one of the accused in the murder of Bluff mum, Bianca Parsons, shot in full view of her three-year-old daughter in February this year, was denied bail when he appeared in the Durban Regional Court today. Darryl Murrisson, 33, abandoned his bail application in March. In opposing bail, the presiding magistrate cited safety risks to witnesses and community members which was unsuccessfully contested by Houston’s lawyer. Parsons was shot in full view of her three-year-old daughter in February whilst she was seated in their vehicle at a local fuel station on Tara Road. Her husband had stepped out to make a purchase at the convenience store. The court heard that Parsons’s shooting was a mistake and that the hit was intended on another woman parked at the garage in a red vehicle. Instead, the shooter fired at Parsons, also in a red car. Parsons family members teared in relief at the magistrate’s decision to deny bail.
