A 67-year-old Effingham woman was declared dead on the scene after she was mauled to death by two pitbull terriers today (Wednesday). Crisis Medical’s Kyle van Reenen said that there was “nothing paramedics could do” to help the lady. It is believed that the woman lives on the property and was familiar with the dogs, according to source close to Durban North News, who said that the woman was alone when she was attacked by the dogs. “Neighbours couldn’t do anything to help except to shout and bang the gate for the dogs to leave her. The fence is too high for anyone to jump over and by the time the paramedics arrive, she was already dead,” said the source. Greenwood Park police spokesperson Sergeant Vincent Mthembu confirmed the incident. “An inquest has been opened at the station,” he said.
