Henry Ward Beecher once said, “We never know the love of a parent until we become parents ourselves.” This was true for mother of one, Meekha Duggan, who saw all that her own mother had done for her with new eyes when she became a mother herself. For Duggan, becoming a mum was everything she imagined and more. “I was told countless times my life would change when I first saw my baby, and it was true. I was overwhelmed by the emotions I felt the first time I heard her cry,” said Duggan. Her little daughter, Brody, is just shy of her second birthday. The Westville Weekly Gazette wishes all mothers a happy Mother’s Day for Sunday, 13 May.
