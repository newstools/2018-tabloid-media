The KH T20 Winter League drew to an exciting close at Kingsmead Stadium in both the finals on Sunday. Group B final teams Tigers CC and AHTP were first on the field at 9am. After winning the toss Tigers were rewarded with a big 196 runs in their allotted 20 overs. Captain M Shakir Gangat managed an impressionable 66. The target proved unreachable by AHTP who collapsed far short with 105 all out. In the Group A outing between defending champions Team Smart and Islamabad United, the former team’s Prenalen Subrayen, of the Dolphins fame, more than impressed with 41 runs off 16 balls smashing three big sixes in a row. After winning the toss, Team Smart looked like they were in trouble early on in the match as wickets quickly tumbled but with some added help from Garth Chizlet they left the pitch with a decent score of 175. Islamabad United looked all fired up as their opening batsmen took to the wicket. It was downhill after the first promising over after Yergesh Naidoo took them apart with 4/4. They fell 56 runs short for a win. And the winners were surprised with a R25 000 windfall each for their efforts. Tigers CC was the most consistent team of the tournament finishing unbeaten. Special awards were presented to the best batmen and bowlers. Zain Patel and Sheldon Swanepoel were each given the most valuable player award.One of the tournament organisers, Yameen Godil, said that they were happy with crowd attendance and that the finals were rewarding for the teams as it was held at the Kingsmead Stadium. “We greatly appreciate this gesture from the KZN Cricket Union. We thank all our sponsors and media partner for making this seventh edition of the tournament a success,” said Godil.
