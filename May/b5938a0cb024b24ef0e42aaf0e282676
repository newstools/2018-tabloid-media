It was a vibrant and colourful event with Scottish melodies playing in the background at the Amanzimtoti Highland Gathering that took place on 28 April at Hutchison Park. The 54th annual event was hosted by Toti Lions and supported by Sapphire Coast Tourism. The day was rich in culture and called for all to come together to celebrate Scottish and Celtic heritage. Proud Scottish Pipe Bands came in their numbers to take part in the festivities. The different bands came from all over to showcase their bagpipes, kilts as well as compete in piping, drumming and highland dancing. “I specifically came here today all the way from Scotland just to be a part of today’s festivities. It’s my first time at this event and in South Africa and I must say I have been very well looked after by the Transvaal Scottish Pipes and Drums”, said a very happy Craig Munro from Scotland. The family friendly gathering also included entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of the Scottish culture such as food and social games. Attendees from far and wide got to enjoy good food and a sense of togetherness as a community through music and culture.
