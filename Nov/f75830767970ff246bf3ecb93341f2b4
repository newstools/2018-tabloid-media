Police in KwaZulu-Natal have issued a stern warning for residents to be alert at all times and not to allow strangers into their homes. This warning comes after the reported incidents in the province where the criminals gain entrance into properties under false pretences and rob the occupants.  Police spokesperson, Col Thembeka Mbele, said, “Often, they will arrive clad in blue work wear and when the victims open the gate, they would then be robbed of their valuables. “The community need to be cautious and alert at all times. “Do not let the strangers into your home; ask for an identity document or work identification card as proof of employment. There is a trend where criminals arrive in luxury vehicles and hoot at the gates. “Most often, the owners never check before opening the gates. Criminals are employing this modus operandi as they are aware that most residents are very lax.”
