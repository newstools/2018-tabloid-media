It was a manic Monday morning in Mount Moriah, Phoenix, as protesters wreaked havoc on the roadway by burning debris and scattering tree branches across the tar preventing motorists from passing. Traffic built up for kilometres as the R102 towards the M25 and Duffs Road as well as Whitehouse and Southgate in the direction of Glen Anil were heavily congested, causing huge traffic delays for motorists headed to work and school. There was a strong police presence and eventually, protesters dispersed, leaving scores of irate motorists in their wake.
