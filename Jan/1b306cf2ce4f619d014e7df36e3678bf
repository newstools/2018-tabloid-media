A group of excited Grade one learners reached for the stars on their first day at school on Wednesday, 17 January. The learners were starting their year at Springfield Secondary school which was abuzz with excited students on their first day back. There to greet the learners were DJ’s from Al Ansaar radio who were set up for an outside broadcast of their breakfast show. The Al Ansaar team also handed out hampers sponsored by Willowton Group, Coca Cola and Frimax. Long-time school principal, Omar Mohammed was glad to have the radio station add to the fun of the first day back. “It was very exciting to have Al Ansaar here and it was a great opportunity for our learners to receive the hampers and vouchers. I know they are very deserving of it,” said Mohammed. Also joining the breakfast team was Al Ansaar executive director, Krish Naidoo. “It’s been a wonderful morning for us,” said Naidoo. “We participate in a lot of outreach programmes, that is the very core of Al Ansaar and today’s programme is to recognise those children from disadvantaged areas who we believe require the participation of Al Ansaar,” added Naidoo. Dropping off her daughter was Lana Yacoob who had attended Springfield Secondary herself as a young girl. “It’s very good to see these hampers being given to the learners, they are helping those in need and giving back to the community,” said Yacoob. There were no back to school tears on site, but some solemn learners were still easing into the day beside their all-smiles-peers.
