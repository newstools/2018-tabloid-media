Disaster teams in KwaZulu-Natal were dispatched to the areas of Newcastle after a tornado-like storm left a path of destruction after it tore through the township of Osizweni, ripping off roofs, bringing down huge trees and power lines, and leaving thousands of residents without electricity. Hardest hit were the rural areas including Indaka which was almost completely obliterated by heavy hail fuelled by strong gale force winds. Other areas badly affected include parts of Mooi River, Estcourt, Ladysmith, Roosboom, and Dundee. In Indaka relief teams were assessing the damage and handing out blankets, tents and roof plastics to affected families. A full assessment of the damage has not been finished. Osizweni residents said the storm, which hit at about 11pm last Thursday, resulted in flash floods making the area inaccessible. Local disaster teams were out in full force and worked around the clock to respond to emergencies while they were given more manpower with the involvement of the Provincial Disaster Management Centre. “We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the affected communities in the Newcastle Municipality. We are doing everything possible through our disaster teams to assist communities in need at this point. We are taking stock of all the incidents that have occurred. I have tasked the Provincial Disaster Center to coordinate with local municipalities and ensure that it is all hands on deck in caring for those in distress at this period” said Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. Dube-Ncube has urged communities in KwaZulu-Natal, to be alert at all times as weather abnormalities were becoming regular and more frequent. “It has become difficult to predict weather patterns due to these uncertain trends under the influence of climate change. Our greatest weapon is to be prepared at all times and stay up to date with reports concerning weather situations,” added Dube-Ncube.
