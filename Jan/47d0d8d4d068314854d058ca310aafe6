Joy, anticipation and trepidation filtered through the air today (Wednesday, 17 Jaunary) as learners from across Durban welcomed yet another new school year, some for the very first time as doors re-opened. For two Durban North siblings Razan and Shaila Karriem it is a new start to an exciting year. Razan (6) is in Grade R at Fairways on Northlands Pre-primary School for the first time today while his sister Shaila (8) is overjoyed to see her friends again in Grade 3. Their mom, Janine, said that preparations for school have gone well and the kids were excited. “I am happy that Razan is in a new environment, it is a good start for him and it will help him get independence.” The siblings could not stop smiling when the Durban North News visited them on Monday while they eagerly prepared for the new school year. Durban North News wishes all learners continued success in 2018.
