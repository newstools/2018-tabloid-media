Durban North learners Joanna Laura Smith and Kaamil-Inaam Naicker were on the top ten list of the top achievers in KwaZulu-Natal. Smith was one of the province’s best performers and was recognised as the top learner for maths and physical science in the Umlazi District. Talking about her achievement, Smith said that it was unexpected. “I am ecstatic with the results and it is all thanks to hard work,” she said. The 18-year-old Smith from Danville Park Girls High School bagged eight distinctions for maths, physical science, life orientation, Afrikaans, drama, applied maths, English and life sciences. Smith was placed third in South Africa in the quintile five schools. She told Durban North News that she will be studying actuarial science at Stellenbosch University. Her message to the 2018 matrics: “Find the motivation within yourself and put in your best.” Her fellow top 10 achiever 17-year- old Dux, Kaamil-Inaam Naicker, was placed second in the Umlazi District, and seventh in the province with seven distinctions. Naicker said that he did not believe his outstanding achievement. “I was not expecting to do this well but I had hope. The English paper was really hard. I am happy with my performance it shows that working hard really pays off,” he said. Naicker will be pursuing chemical engineering at the University of Pretoria. His message for the 2018 matrics is to keep pushing. “Start from day one and keep pushing don’t wait for the trail exams, do everything you can, if you put in the work you will get great results,” he said.
