A wanted suspect linked to business break-in cases and other crime between Amanzimtoti and Scottburgh was arrested in a joint operation between Umkomaas Crime Prevention members and the Umzinto K9 Unit in the South Coast, on Tuesday. eThekwini Outer South Cluster communications officer Captain C Rhynes said, “On Tuesday, 3 July 2018, at 12:45, Warrant Officer Logan Naidoo, Constable Ryan Armugam and Constable Thamsanqa Magcaba from Umkomaas Crime Prevention received some information concerning stolen goods. They immediately proceeded to the given address, with the assistance of Umzinto K9 Dog unit. They proceeded to Donganya area to the said address, and found one male aged 38 years old and a female suspect aged 24 years old in possession of stolen property.” She added, “In their home, was a number of cellphones, computers, clothing items, tools, air gun, perfumes, cash of R9 800, jewellery and house breaking implements. All recovered goods came to the value of R130 000. The suspects were immediately taken to Umkomaas SAPS and charged for Possession of stolen Property.” According to Cpt Rhynes, the arrested male suspect has been already linked to 15 cases of business break ins, in Amanzimtoti and Scottsburgh. “Investigation into further linking the suspect to other areas and cases is still ongoing.
It is suspected that he is also linked to cases in Harding. The accused’s modus operand would be breaking through the roofs of businesses, disconnecting the alarms and then cutting open the business safes. This is an excellent arrest made by Umkomaas SAPS of a repeat offender,” Cpt Rhynes said. Brigadier Vukani Mgobhozi, Acting eThekwini Outer South Cluster Commander said, “Well done to Umkomaas Crime Prevention! I commend them on this outstanding arrest and recovery of stolen goods!
