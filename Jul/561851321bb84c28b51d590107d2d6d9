The Cell C Sharks rugby team will play their first match on the Moses Mabhida field, in a spectacle that is expected to attract thousands of visitors to the city. The action takes places on Friday, 17 August when the Sharks will compete against the Union Bordeux Begles from France in the Durban Challenge which will see a rocky relationship between the Sharks and the city on the mend. This in a joint bid to promote inclusivity and unity through sport. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, 27 June, eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede said the match is one of many initiatives that the city will undertake as part of their partnership with the Cell C Sharks. “This spectacle not only brings visitors to the city, it provides a platform for us to position Durban as Africa’s sporting capital,” said Gumede. Sharks COO, Eduard Coetzee said the match showed the ties between the Sharks and the city. “We are very excited to put this match up in partnership with Durban tourism,” said Coetzee. Gumede emphasised that the partnership would help to bring about social cohesion.
“The 100th anniversary of (former president Nelson Mandela’s) birth is an opportunity to recommit to his principles. Our vision is to use sports for social cohesion and nation building,” she said. Coetzee echoed these views saying that community is one of the Sharks’ values. “It is important for us not to be an elitist brand, but a community brand,” he said. “We deal with social inequality and racism on a daily basis. The influence that sport can have on relieving social issues and assuring the future of our rainbow nation is important,” added Coetzee. General Manager for the Moses Mabhida Stadium, Vusi Mazibuko welcomed the match saying that the stadium was built as a multipurpose stadium. “We are excited. It is an opportunity for all of us Durbanites to embrace this moment,”  he added. Durban will also host the Test Match between the Springboks and Argentina on Saturday, 18 August at Kings Park Stadium.
