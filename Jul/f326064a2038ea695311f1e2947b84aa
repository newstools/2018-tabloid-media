Alert Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) Officers once again proved their mettle when they kept surveillance on a suspicious man and apprehended him after they discovered him to be an alleged self-confessed drug dealer in Phoenix on Friday. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, RUSA head, Prem Balram, said, “The alleged drug dealer was found in possession of heroin. “Reaction Officers were on patrol in the area when they spotted an individual behaving in a suspicious manner. Officers kept observation over him from a distance and followed him when he entered a canal. “The suspect climbed into a manhole and was in the process of smoking heroin when he was apprehended. Upon searching him, 15 wrappings of heroin were found in his pocket. During an interview, the 24-year-old confirmed that he was dealing in drugs and supplied scrap metal collectors who frequented scrap yards in the area. He was placed under arrest and handed over to police.” Balram added, “RUSA members are highly skilled to suss illegal activity. The members have made countless drug busts in Phoenix and surrounding areas. In a community rife with the scourge of drugs, every arrest is important, however, in no time the perpetrators are back on the streets. “As disheartening as this is, RUSA members will strive to keep the drug arrests rolling in, in a bid to help curb the drug pandemic in the area.”
