A non-governmental organisation, Sisterhood of Power, is raising awareness against gender-based violence through photography themed art. Sisterhood of Power hosts an annual awareness campaign in Newcastle and Ladysmith, called “Sifelani” – meaning “why are we dying?”, in an effort to try and reduce the number of abuse cases reported each year. The NGO’s founder, Bathandwa Nkambule said their organization was created to primarily focus on the welfare of women, “Our NGO focuses on trying to build and support women who feel helpless after being subjected to abuse. We want to send a message that you can overcome, you can rise up, you can reclaim your power against abuse and we are here to support, uplift and fight this together.” The NGO is hosting their awareness campaign at the beginning of next month, where they will tell stories of abuse through photography, where they have themed it “Still I rise”, inspired by Maya Angelou’s uplifting poem. In a country with a high number of femicide cases, NGO’s like Sisterhood of Power, are trying to create the necessary awareness, so that women are aware and can empower themselves. In one gripping case that shook the country last year, Sandile Mantsoe was handed an effective 32 years in jail for the murder of his then girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. In 2017, Mantsoe was reported to have beaten, killed and burnt his girlfriend, Karabo. He then allegedly buried the badly burnt body, in an effort to hide his malicious crime. Research has indicated that at least half of murdered women in South Africa, die at the hands of their intimate partners. The South Africa femicide rate is five-times more than the global rate.
