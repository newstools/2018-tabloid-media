What he thought was a train ride to freedom so he could enjoy his spoils was in fact the beginning of a nightmare which ended in cuffs for a Warner Beach house breaker on Tuesday morning. The alleged daylight robber had executed his criminal deed on Massey Road early on Tuesday when the homeowner called ET Rapid Response for assistance. Spokesman for ET, Tony Lokker said, “At around 8:15am, we received a call from a resident in Warner Beach that he just had an intruder in his house. A detailed description was circulated to our vehicles, as well as on the CCPO – Crime channel. Not too long afterward, a suspect fitting the same description, was seen climbing on a train at Warner Beach. Multiple vehicles were dispatched to all stations nearby.” The suspect was observed getting off the train at Pahla Station. “When the train arrived, Lloyed climbed on the train in search of the suspect. He spotted the suspect, who once he had noticed Lloyed, jumped off the train. Lloyed chased the suspect who ran into thick bushes alongside the station.”
The area was cordoned off by CCPO, Blue Security – Durban, ET Rapid, Amanzimtoti SAPS and Umlazi K9.
Lokker added, “Cst Ngcongo and Mkhize from the Durban Dog Unit arrived swiftly. Together with their canine partner, Pumba, they tracked looking for the suspect. Pumba managed to track and find the suspect in the thick bush. The suspect was positively identified and detained. Items taken were also recovered. It was great team work by all involved.”
