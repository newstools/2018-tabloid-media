An inquest has been opened by the Ezakheni police after a seven-year-old child lost her life in a caravan blaze in what seemed to have been a “freak accident” last week. Six of her friends sustained serious to light injuries in the blaze. Both the police and members of the fire department were at the scene
taking statements in trying to piece together evidence on what might have caused of the fire. The injured children were rushed to the St Chad’s Clinic for treatment. Bystanders tried to douse the flames with buckets of water and sand, but to no avail as the flames quickly engulfed the caravan, completely destroying it. The caravan was parked at a residential premises in D section Ezakheni.
