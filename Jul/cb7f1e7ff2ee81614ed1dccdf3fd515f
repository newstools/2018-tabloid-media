Leading up to the 2018 Vodacom Durban July at the Greyville Racecourse on Saturday, racing fans had a great morning last Thursday during gallops when they watched 13 of the 18 thoroughbreds named in the final field being put through their paces from the 800 metre mark, riding in pairs or with stable mates. The five runners not available for the gallops were filmed earlier in the week in Gauteng and theirs were played on a big screen at Greyville Racecourse and then dissected by the panel of experts. Just as fascinating for the crowd that turned out to watch the form of the July runners and enjoy the free coffee and sticky buns were the ten models showing off outfits from the Vodacom Durban July Fashion Experience programme, giving punters tips on what to wear on the big raceday.
