Chaos erupted in the small sleepy town of Colenso when at least 500 Inkanyezi community members gathered to protest in the area after electricity was cut off by Alfred Duma Municipality. The protesters caused damage small businesses and municipality property as they closed off all the main roads leading into Colenso and the nearby township. Newcastle public order policing and the Colenso police were on high-alert on Sunday (1 July) evening as reports of a protest were imminent, as protestors tried to close off the R103 and began stoning vehicles. Colenso police managed to restore order, but the angry mob moved into the town. This morning (Monday, 2 July), at around five, tryes were burnt on the road and cement boulders were used as barricades. Protestors, armed with traditional weapons, threw glass bottles and rocks at the police while they tried to restore order in the town. As the situation began to worsen, and talks proved futile, police shot rubber bullets and used stun-grenades to disperse the crowd. A Ladysmith Herald journalist was caught in the middle of the onslaught with glass bottles and stones barely missing her. According to officials, the Alfred Duma Municipality was expected to turn the electricity to the area back on, with questions remaining unanswered as to why was it turned off in the first place. At the time of publishing, police remained in the area monitoring the situation and effecting possible arrests, with at least 50 people already taken in. The R103 has since been cleared and is reopened for use.
